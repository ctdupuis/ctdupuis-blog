It's crazy to see how far Flatiron has taken me in such a short amount of time. In just a few months, I've gone from struggling to understand scraping and basic CLI to designing a full fledged web application. The majority of the CSS on the project is all thanks to the Corneal gem, but the mechanics of user logins, signups, validation and authentication were all done from scratch. Knowing I was able to achieve something like this is such an intoxicating feeling. It's funny how something so small in the grand scheme of this program can mean so much at this moment in time. 
As frustrating as the labs can be, going into project mode is rarely the case. The main difference to me is that I have the freedom to design projects around my personal interests. While the labs normally have content that is very relatable to an internet friendly person such as myself, the projects allow me to take an idea in my head and form it into a finished product. The feeling I get from seeing the product in its final state is like no other. I mean, I spent around an hour creating users and adding games to this application after it was finished. Most of it was for testing purposes, but some of it was just to marvel in what I'd created and trying to get myself to believe that it actually works consistently. 
The Sinatra project was a BLAST, and it has me fired up and ready to start Rails. The Sinatra framework is so powerful especially in compliance with ActiveRecord, I simply cannot wait to see what Rails has to offer. I'll definitely need to brush up on my CSS in the meantime.
