It's the final week of the cohort. I have so many feelings, it's hard to begin to describe. 

It's **exciting**. I'm so close to finishing my course and starting down this new career path. I'm so far beyond ready to have a career I'm passionate about, and not feel like my job is just a placeholder until I've reached my career goals.

It's **unnerving**. I'm traversing into unknown territory. It's the exact feeling when you start a new job for the first time. You're in an unfamiliar environment, with unfamiliar people, and it can be anxiety-inducing. My experiences with Flatiron have helped ease this feeling, but I can't imagine it will fully disappear any time soon. 

It's **saddening**. Some of the best memories I've had are with my cohort mates. We had some really fun times in Office Hours after hours and the Water Cooler room, laughing and poking fun while solving some difficult problems that would sometimes take multiple hours to complete. I have every intention of maintaining these newly formed relationships, but I will always look back at these times as the good ol' days.

It's **satisfying**. There's nothing quite like the feeling of taking a step back from where you are and remembering where you came from. It's crazy to think one of the first major obstacles in the curriculum was learning how to manipulate nested hashes in Ruby, and now whenever I initialize a new backend, I use nested hashes to create seed data. Nothing beats the feeling of taking an idea for a web app and seeing the finished, polished product of that idea weeks later. I've learned so much in a relatively short amount of time, and the curriculum has taught me a lot about technical skills, but also how to adapt to situations and qute literally how to use Google.

I'm taking a short break from adding the finishing touches to my React project to write this, and I'd like to take a little bit of time describing the process and the journey leading up to it.

I love animals, so the idea of Critter Cottage has lingered in my head since the Sinatra Project so many months ago. I started with Films for the CLI project, video games for Sinatra, and music for Rails and JavaScript. React felt like the perfect time to finally bust out the shelter idea again. My previous projects were more entertainment based, but coming into React, I finally felt fully equipped to build something more professional, and feel like I could build an app that would serve a purpose beyond entertaining.

Although the app is just a demo version and none of the animals are actually being adopted, the idea of designing an online architecture to help animals in need really resonated with me, and the passion of coding and living creatures combined to create the final product. I consider this project to be my Magnum Opus. It is definitely the project I enjoyed the most, just barely ahead of the Rails project.

I feel Critter Cottage is a nice blend of all the skills I have acquired throughout the program. It takes the technical skills of the backend, the logic and conditionals to maintain data on the frontend, and I even learned how to implement Bootstrap, a concept I abandoned in Rails for favor of custom CSS. Overall the project was a blast. Through blogs and documentation, I learned how to set up a file upload for images and how to render saved images from within the project directory. Additionally, my cohort mates were vital in helping me figure out how to display proper error messages. Thanks to Bootstrap, the app looks professional with a calm, subtle color scheme.

I'll always look back on these days at Flatiron with glee, but the time has come to set my focus on the future instead of the past. I'll certainly miss these times and I know career searching is going to have it's ups and downs, just like the curriculum work itself. However, thanks to all the tough labs, sleepless nights, hour crunching, peer and instructor support, and a strong learning foundation, I feel as confident as ever turning my sights toward my new career. Thanks for everything Flatiron. I'm proud to call myself a programmer, but most importantly, I'm proud to be a part of this community.
